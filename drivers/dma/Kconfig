	  DMA engines can do asynchronous data transfers without
	  involving the host CPU.  Currently, this framework can be
	  used to offload memory copies in the network stack and
	  RAID operations in the MD driver.

config INTEL_IOATDMA
	tristate "Intel I/OAT DMA support"
	depends on PCI && X86
	select DMA_ENGINE
	select DCA
	help
	  Enable support for the Intel(R) I/OAT DMA engine present
	  in recent Intel Xeon chipsets.

	  Say Y here if you have such a chipset.

	  If unsure, say N.

config INTEL_IOP_ADMA
	tristate "Intel IOP ADMA support"
	depends on ARCH_IOP32X || ARCH_IOP33X || ARCH_IOP13XX
	select DMA_ENGINE
	help
	  Enable support for the Intel(R) IOP Series RAID engines.

config AMCC_PPC440SPE_ADMA
	tristate "AMCC PPC440SPe ADMA support"
	depends on 440SPE || 440SP
	select ASYNC_CORE
	select DMA_ENGINE
	select ARCH_HAS_ASYNC_TX_FIND_CHANNEL
	default y
	---help---
	  Enable support for the AMCC PPC440SPe RAID engines.

config FSL_DMA
	tristate "Freescale Elo and Elo Plus DMA support"
	depends on FSL_SOC
	select DMA_ENGINE
	---help---
	  Enable support for the Freescale Elo and Elo Plus DMA controllers.
	  The Elo is the DMA controller on some 82xx and 83xx parts, and the
	  Elo Plus is the DMA controller on 85xx and 86xx parts.

config MV_XOR
	bool "Marvell XOR engine support"
	depends on PLAT_ORION
	select DMA_ENGINE
	---help---
	  Enable support for the Marvell XOR engine.

config MX3_IPU
	bool "MX3x Image Processing Unit support"
	depends on ARCH_MX3
	select DMA_ENGINE
	default y
	help
	  If you plan to use the Image Processing unit in the i.MX3x, say
	  Y here. If unsure, select Y.

config MX3_IPU_IRQS
	int "Number of dynamically mapped interrupts for IPU"
	depends on MX3_IPU
	range 2 137
	default 4
	help
	  Out of 137 interrupt sources on i.MX31 IPU only very few are used.
	  To avoid bloating the irq_desc[] array we allocate a sufficient
	  number of IRQ slots and map them dynamically to specific sources.

config ARCH_HAS_ASYNC_TX_FIND_CHANNEL
	bool

config DMA_ENGINE
	bool

comment "DMA Clients"
	depends on DMA_ENGINE

config NET_DMA
	bool "Network: TCP receive copy offload"
	depends on DMA_ENGINE && NET
	help
	  This enables the use of DMA engines in the network stack to
	  offload receive copy-to-user operations, freeing CPU cycles.
	  Since this is the main user of the DMA engine, it should be enabled;
	  say Y here.
